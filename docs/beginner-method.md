# Beginner method tips

The steps are based on this page: [How to solve a Rubik's Cube](https://www.cube.academy/how-to-solve-a-rubiks-cube)

The tips are taken from these videos:

## 1. White Cross

- Solve easy edges first
- Think about colors relative to each others
- Avoid white edges in the side bottoms, or tops as it requires more moves
- Try to plan as much as you can
- Know your color scheme
- Be color neutral

## 2. White Corners

### [Prevent bad case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir3BkmVePNQ&t=289s)

When you need to take out a white angle in the bottom right like this:

![White corner in bottom right](/img/beginner/image.png)

avoid doing "R U R'" as it will put white on top and it's long to solve. Instead do "y L' U' L".

### [Preserved solved edges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir3BkmVePNQ&t=358s)

In that case where we have a solved edge on 2nd layer:

![alt text](/img/beginner/image-1.png)

Don't do the sexy move as it will unresolve it. Instead:
- put it away: U
- sexy move: R U R' U'
- put it back: U'
- sexy move: R U R' U'

Same thing when on left:

![alt text](/img/beginner/image-2.png)

- put it away: U'
- sexy move left: L' U' L U
- put it back: U
- sexy move: L' U' L U

When on top like this, just do 3 sexy moves

### [Solving pairs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir3BkmVePNQ&t=406s)

When you have a pair like this:

![Pair](/img/beginner/image-4.png)

Don't do a lefty sexy move, it breaks the pair. Instead:

- Put the white in front of you
- Move the pair away: U
- Open its slot: R
- Insert it: U R'

Same thing on the left:

![Pair](/img/beginner/image-5.png)

- Put the white in front of you
- Move the pair away: U'
- Open its slot: L'
- Insert it: U L

## 3. Second Layer

### [2 Inversed edges in 2nd layer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmeleO65BHc&t=215s)

On the 2nd layer solving, in this case where 2 edges are inversed

![alt text](/img/beginner/image-8.png)

Do this
- Place them on the right face
- R2 U2 R2 U2 R2

### 1 flipped edge in 2nd layer

In this case:

![alt text](/img/beginner/image-9.png)

Do this:
- R U2 R' U
- R U2 R' U
- y
- Lefty Sexy move: L' U' L U

## 4. Yellow Cross

### [Hook in yellow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir3BkmVePNQ&t=451s)

You can put the hook front right of you:

![Hook front-right](/img/beginner/image-6.png)

- f
- sexy move
- f'

Very handy when you have a dot as the "F sexy move F'" will put the cross in front right.
It saves 2 rotations and 1 sexy move

## 5. Yellow Edges

### Sune

Sune algorithm: R U R' U R U2 R'

In the case of next to each other solved edges: Sune algorithm + U

In the case of across edges are solved:

- put them on the sides
- Sune algorithm
- U'
- Sune algorithm
- Solved

## 6. Yellow Corners

### [Extra Niklas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir3BkmVePNQ&t=521s)

Niklas alg: R U' L' U R' U' L U

Mirrored Niklas: L' U R U' L U R' U'

In the case case where you have:
- 1 solved corner
- the corner to its right has a matching color

![alt text](/img/beginner/image-7.png)

Only do 1 niklas holding the solved edge top left.

If it doesn't match, do a mirrored Niklas with the solved edge on the top right. It's done.

## 7. Finish Cube ðŸ¥³

### [Inverse sexy move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ir3BkmVePNQ&t=564s)

If the yellow is on the right face like this:

![yellow on right face](/img/beginner/image-10.png)

Inverse the sexy move: U R U' R'
