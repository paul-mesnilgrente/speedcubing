# Introduction

CFOP stands for:

- C: Cross
- F: F2L: First 2 layers
- O: OLL: Orientation of the Last Layer
- P: PLL: Permutation of the Last Layer

## 1. White cross

## 2. F2L

Solves the first two layers at the same time.

## 3. OLL

Creates a yellow face, but the layer is still wrong.

Total of 57 cases. Using the 2-Look OLL, you can create the yellow face in 2 steps knowing 9 different algorithms.

## 4. PLL

Gets the yellow face in order to have a solved layer.

21 cases usually describe by letters like J-Perm. There's also a 2-Look PLL for solving PLL in 2 steps.
